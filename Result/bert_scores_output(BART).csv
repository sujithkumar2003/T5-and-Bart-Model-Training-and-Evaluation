Lt. Col. Weinstein was almost certainly killed in one of these strikes, the group says. New America tracks drone strikes in Pakistan and says at least four militants were killed in that attack.ason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent member of the Taliban.Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure.

There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to a senior Pakistani official. Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and de facto exile.After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody. Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown ""no interest in mvelopment""The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy. Some families have been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones.CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment, as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan.Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the WhiTe House on the National Security Council must oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and Joint Special Operations Command. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and ""de-conflict"" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case.There is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened.Curtis' release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012. Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, but it's unlikely that the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys.Coleman was pregnant when she was taken hostage. The name of the child is unknown. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network. The U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release, says CNN's John Sutter.",0.6500089764595032,0.7851710319519043,0.7112253904342651

Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers.A living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. In some countries like Bangladesh, the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month.paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt.

'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected,' it adds.Baptism.ce, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields. The government recently renounced the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis' 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from.ist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said.The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh.

""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Tim Durken said. The fires were started in southea.The fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields. The flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. The lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds and carried across the Pacific Ocean.Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered.sets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.

"Ben Affleck admits he asked PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" to avoid mentioning his slave-owning ancestor Dean Obeidallah says the actor and the show were right to leave the detail out ","Ben Affleck lobbied producers of a PBS show, ""Finding Your Roots,"" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole. Cole was a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's. Affleck's grandfather was a slave owner, too.n an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. When the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to the request. Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.Affleck says he asked Gates to delete reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck: ""I didn't want any television show about my fam"" WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. Lynton responded, ""all things being equal, I would definitely take it out""Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request. But it seems likely that he did. Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates ""agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with""PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Let's be clear: ""Finding Your Roots"" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing.There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck.Gates: ""I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program"" Affleck's great-grandfather was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched in the Civil War, Gates says.ed for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964."" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive.Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show.

"Mered Medhanie and Ermias Ghermay 'have made Â£72m in last two years'Medhanie heard on police wiretap mocking the fatal overcrowding of ships Ghermay reportedly said: 'I don't know what happened, they probably died'Pair wanted over major smuggling ring, but are hiding in lawless Libya ","Ermias Ghermay and his accomplice Mered Medhanie thought to have made £72m smuggling migrants in the last two years. One of them was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading boats in the Mediterranean, it has been reported.Medhanie, 34, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years.Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two.Ghermay and Medhanie are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. They are exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. The pair enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist group.Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. In another wire tap recording, Medhanie is heard saying: 'We do an ille.action. We do an Illeaction''I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.gal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates.Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race. They lock those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit. Hundreds of migrants died over the weekend.Passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned' Conversely, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February said he was placed on an upper level.Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but to join relatives in northern Europe.Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground.Harrowing details emerge of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. Crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday. Allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond. 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast.coast of Libya on Sunday.

Italian Coast Guard ship Gregoretti prepares to disembark one of the 24 bodies.Only 28 people, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck when it capsized.Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim.

"Justice Dept sent 7-page letter to House Speaker John Boehner explaining why the former IRS official was allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment Federal prosecutor in charge of the case sent his decision to Capitol Hill on the last day before his own resignation took effect Lerner offered a self-serving opening statement during a 2013 hearing, but refused to take questions even though she was under subpoena Hearing focused on the IRS's habit of targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny based on words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names The DOJ says she can't be prosecuted for defying the subpoena 'because she made only general claims of innocence' and offered few details ","Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The IRS has been accused of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups.Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny.Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing. She then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen dropped his bomb on Congress just days after Lerner's testimony.Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner, who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversigh of the House of Representatives, approved the citation one day before leaving office.t committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to testify. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing.'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to ""testimony"" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted for her refusal to testify''Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy,' he added.Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic Nati.During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner. Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months.onal contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message,' he said.Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' he said.Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said. 'We need to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable'",0.7589014768600464,0.8431409001350403,0.798806369304657

"Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women Held at Broadmoor since being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia He is now being considered for a move to the low-security Priory unit ","Peter Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. Despite being one of the country's most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy low security unit. Families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him.Sutcliffe said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move.'This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake,' he said. A source at the prison said Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move. He had been previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room.He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music. Broadmoor prison hospital houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals. Potential plans to move him from the hospital to the Priory have been mooted. He used a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north.ed to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours.

Get Me Out Of Here!There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music.It is thought Sutcliffe would be transferred to the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland. Offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit.Broadmoor houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210.

He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition.The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’�s being rewarded. I hope the lifestyle kills him’Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984.It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released.The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move. The Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.

"Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams Scientists now believe a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks The same skeptics also warn of the health risks associated with consuming less than 3,000 milligrams Average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day ","For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt. But new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to heart disease and stroke. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.The federal government is preparing its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit.although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?'The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no need for salt limits.Skeptics say a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000milligrams also raises health risk. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommen found that they had lower blood pressure.ded limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. Low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association.grees that current sodium intake is too high' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, said there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure.

"Geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and 'Jesus Family tomb'Claims chemical signature proves James Ossuary was at Jerusalem site Chalk box bears inscription â€˜James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesusâ€™Find suggests Jesus fathered a child and was married ","Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physic was involved.After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary.ontroversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, 'Judah,. son of Jesus'The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place. The tomb dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus. Dr Shimron's work has renewed the controversy over the Tal piot tomb.The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. It stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries.The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago' Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box mat was forged.Ossuary in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary. Owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris.the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found.Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossusaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the 'holy' location.Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individual. names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.San Francisco based author David Fitzgerald believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to Fitzgerald.to a writer and leading atheist activist. He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence.'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith,' says David Fitzgerald. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted,' he adds. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all,' adds Fitzgerald.Paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs'Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all' He added: 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria'mething Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did,' Dr Shumron said. 'I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Jesus Family tomb'Bones found in the ossuaries could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection. This is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under  the name of the ancient city of Tel Aviv.a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority.
